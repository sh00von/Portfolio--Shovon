          Mono Alarm (&ldquo;the app&rdquo;) is a minimalist alarm, timer, and stopwatch app
          developed by Md Minaruzzaman Shovon. This privacy policy explains what data the app
          handles. In short: we do not collect or store any of your personal information on our
          servers. All of your alarms, timers, and settings stay on your device. The app
          integrates Google AdMob to display advertisements.

            <strong className="text-[#111111]">We do not collect any personal data.</strong>{" "}
            Mono Alarm does not require user accounts, sign-ups, or credentials. We do not
            collect or store your name, email, phone number, or any other personal details.

        <Section title="Your Alarms and App Data">
          <p>
            Your alarms, alarm groups, timers, timer presets, stopwatch state, and app settings
            are stored <strong className="text-[#111111]">locally on your device only</strong>.
            This data is never uploaded to us or any third party. Uninstalling the app removes
            this data from your device.

        </Section>

        <Section title="Permissions">
          <p>
            To function as an alarm clock, the app requests certain device permissions such as
            scheduling exact alarms, posting notifications, showing full-screen alarm alerts,
            and running a foreground service so alarm and timer tones can play reliably. These
            permissions are used solely to deliver alarms and timers on time. They are not used
            to collect or transmit any personal information.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Advertisements (Google AdMob)">
          <p>
            We use Google AdMob to serve advertisements in the app to help fund its development.
            AdMob may collect and process certain data, such as:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Your device&apos;s Advertising ID (e.g., Android Ad ID).</li>
            <li>Device information (model, operating system, screen size, carrier).</li>
            <li>IP address (used to estimate general location).</li>
            <li>Ad diagnostic and performance data (to monitor ad deliveries and prevent fraud).</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            You can manage or reset your Advertising ID or opt out of personalized ads at any
            time through your device&apos;s Google Settings. For more information, please review
